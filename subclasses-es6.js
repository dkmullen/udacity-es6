/*
Both Tree and Maple are JavaScript classes. The Maple class is a "subclass" of Tree and uses the extends keyword to set itself as a "subclass". To get from the "subclass" to the parent class, the super keyword is used. Did you notice that super was used in two different ways? In Maple's constructor method, super is used as a function. In Maple's changeSeason() method, super is used as an object!
